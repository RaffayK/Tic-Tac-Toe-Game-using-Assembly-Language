## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Project Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players use symbols X and O on a 3x3 board. The rules are:
- Players alternate placing their symbol in an empty square.
- The game ends when a player forms a line of three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when all squares are filled without a winning combination, resulting in a draw.

### 1.2 Scope of the Project

This project focuses on implementing Tic-Tac-Toe using the Emu8086 emulator, requiring a keyboard for gameplay. It showcases how assembly language can be used to recreate this classic game on an old microprocessor.

### 1.3 Modules in Project

- **Data Segment**
- **Main Loop**
- **Game Pointer**

### 1.4 Project Features

- Utilizes Emu8086
- Keyboard-based gameplay
- Implements a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game

## Chapter 2: Analysis

### 2.1 Existing System

Traditional record-keeping for games like Tic-Tac-Toe is paper-based, prone to inconsistencies and errors. Our software eliminates manual records, enabling easy data retrieval and reducing workload.

### 2.2 Proposed System

The new system addresses the drawbacks of the old manual system by providing a software solution that is consistent, efficient, and user-friendly. It accounts for economical bandwidth and user needs, making data management seamless.

## Chapter 3: System Implementation

### 3.1 Introduction

The 8086, a 16-bit processor by Intel from the 70s, started the x86 architecture. Emu8086 is an emulator that allows modern computers to run programs developed for the 8086. It includes an assembly language editor, recreating an authentic user experience on PCs.
